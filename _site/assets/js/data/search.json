    "content": "Annotations of various tutorials on starting out in Volatility, a python-based tool for Host-Based Forensics and Incident Responders. This tool is for digital investigation, and requires the repository up on Github and a .vmem file for collection.sTutorials Used            Tutorial      Author      Comments                  Memory Forensics Using the Volatility Framework      Professor K      the most straightforward video              VOLATILITY 3 CHEATSHEET      Ashley Pearson      Volatility 2 vs 3 differences              (EASIEST) Install Volatility on Windows (Standalone)      Computer Science Basics      Skip to 0:45 seconds              How to Use Volatility for Memory Forensics and Analysis      Neil Fox      Goes a bit more in depth on malfind and code injection              Rapid Windows Memory Analysis with Volatility 3      John Hammond      Going a bit further (needs BTLO)      These are the resources in order that I used to get more familiar with the tool. They’re all pretty straightforward, and unlike MemProcFS, it required minimal setupIngredients  Python 3 (to run the vol.py script)  Volatility 3 (use the .zip file in the github repo)  .vmem Cadaver0. InstallationUsing Volatility 3, download the .zip file from their Github RepoGithub Repo &gt; Releases &gt; Source Code (.zip)cd into the repository and runvol.py -f &lt;.VMEM SAMPLE&gt; windows.info1. Quick Command Toolboxvol.py -f &lt;.vmem sample&gt; &lt;module&gt;Note: I used the cridex.vmem example that Professor K showcased in his tutorialNote: I used python 3python vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.infopython vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.pslistpython vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.pstreepython vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.psscanpython vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.netscanpython vol.py -f cridex.vmem socketspython vol.py -f cridex.vmem -o . window.dumpfiles --pid 1640 (this gets the exe and associated dlls)python vol.py -cridex.vmem -o . windows.memmap --dump --pid 1640strings 1640.dmp | grep -Fi \"weird thing, etc\" -C 5python python vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.malfind 2. AnnotationsHighly recommend that you actually watch these videos or read through them, these are more of a quick memory jog and so while they make sense to me since I’ve watched them, they’re probably not as insightful as at least giving the video a watch.Professor K Probably the most straightforward out of all the tutorials, he just dives right into it. Keep in mind that he uses a Linux host to examine a .vmem image of an infected Windows machine. He is also using Volatility 2. I didn’t have much trouble getting past this on a Windows workstation using Volatility 3 and Python 3, but you may need to pull up Ashley Pearson’s Volatility 2-3 cheatsheet.Varonis Unlike the other tutorials, this one goes more into malfind in the Identifying Injected Code partThis displays a list of processes that Volatility suspects may contain injected code based on the header information displayed in hex, the permissions, and some extracted assembly code, just because a process is listed in the output it doesn't mean the process is 100% malware."

    "content": "Just a brief overview on a big update to this site from the old one, what it’s for, and why.Use this as a repo for cluttered minds. Not sure if you’re a tech worker, artist, barista, or the like but this website is a collection of various resources and annotations for me to use. Hopefully you’ll find them useful too.OriginsTech StackThis site uses the Gitpage + Jekyll stack with the Chirpy theme.Yeah, I got rid of the old MERN one, but that was a cost and upkeep reason. I’m here to show documentation mainly not be a developerArt  If you’re looking for my art portfolio, that would be technomancer-01.comI think this jekyll setup is much better suited towards documentation, although I am already seeing that it loads images better so I may use it for art as well. One big component for me is the Tome Fragment aspect of them, how we’re going to treat things as if they are actual historical documents to be analyzed.Projects: On the Nature of Tarnished Souls, Bloodborne in Wonderland, Coruscant Library, DnD, Tales From the Leyline Road, Delta Green, m4ven.OS, and Medicine Bun.TechThe meat of why you are here. I overhauled this site specifically because I wanted it to be more documentation focused instead of artsy, although it still seeps through.Goals---Forensics (Plague Doctor)Threat Hunting (Huntsman)---Goals (More Specific)---Splunk AWS CertificationsForensics (CFE)Bug Bounties---ProjectsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default. But it can be enabled by:---Memprocfs: Small NASA Booklet.
