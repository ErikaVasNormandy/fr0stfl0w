    "content": "Just a brief overview on a big update to this site from the old one, what it’s for, and why.Use this as a repo for cluttered minds. Not sure if you’re a tech worker, artist, barista, or the like but this website is a collection of various resources and annotations for me to use. Hopefully you’ll find them useful too.OriginsTech StackThis site uses the Gitpage + Jekyll stack with the Chirpy theme.Yeah, I got rid of the old MERN one, but that was a cost and upkeep reason. I’m here to show documentation mainly not be a developerArt  If you’re looking for my art portfolio, that would be technomancer-01.comI think this jekyll setup is much better suited towards documentation, although I am already seeing that it loads images better so I may use it for art as well. One big component for me is the Tome Fragment aspect of them, how we’re going to treat things as if they are actual historical documents to be analyzed.Projects: On the Nature of Tarnished Souls, Bloodborne in Wonderland, Coruscant Library, DnD, Tales From the Leyline Road, Delta Green, m4ven.OS, and Medicine Bun.TechThe meat of why you are here. I overhauled this site specifically because I wanted it to be more documentation focused instead of artsy, although it still seeps through.Goals---Forensics (Plague Doctor)Threat Hunting (Huntsman)---Goals (More Specific)---Splunk AWS CertificationsForensics (CFE)Bug Bounties---ProjectsFor website performance reasons, the mathematical feature won’t be loaded by default.
