AnnotationsHighly recommend that you actually watch these videos or read through them, these are more of a quick memory jog and so while they make sense to me since I’ve watched them, they’re probably not as insightful as at least giving the video a watch.Professor K Probably the most straightforward out of all the tutorials, he just dives right into it. Keep in mind that he uses a Linux host to examine a .vmem image of an infected Windows machine. He is also using Volatility 2. I didn’t have much trouble getting past this on a Windows workstation using Volatility 3 and Python 3, but you may need to pull up Ashley Pearson’s Volatility 2-3 cheatsheet.Timestamps1:08 - Cridex Sample ( I already downloaded this and put it in my volatility folder for ease of access)1:52 - Extract to memdump (user created)2:45 - Runs volatility as a command, but I just did python vol.py3:03 - volatility 3-2.4.1\\vol.py -f cridex_memdump\\cridex.vmem image.info----&gt; -f: use the following file (cridex.vmem) image.info----&gt; image.info is a basic Volatility module----&gt; vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.info----&gt; this module gives basic system info, like when it was taken,  mount system 3:46 - vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.info4:15 - vol.py -f cridex.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pslist----&gt; vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.pslist, be aware of any that catch your attention4:45 - All the processes running on this machine5:12 - Takes note of explorer.exe &amp; an unknown reader_s1.exe5:40 - volatility -f cridex.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 pstree----&gt; pip3 install -r .\\requirements.txt -vv5:46 vol.py -f cridex.vmem windows.pstree ----&gt; take note of explorer.exe to reader_s1.exe6:08 View processes currently trying to hide----&gt; vol.py -f cridex.vmem profia vle = Win... psxview----&gt; there's not quite a volatility equivalent , but just gets lumped with pstree and pslist----&gt; vol.py -f .vmem windows.psscan6:20 - The 1st two columns, the pslist &amp; psscan.
