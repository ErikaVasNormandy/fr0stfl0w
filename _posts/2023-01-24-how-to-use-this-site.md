A Repo for Cluttered Minds. Use each card as a review topic for notebooks.
<br>

<!--  ## Origins

When pinging my then boyfriend for ideas, we came up with the name "Scavengers' Repo", mainly as a collection of random things. 

I made the original scavengers-repo.com in 2017 to get a grasp on the whole fullstack engineering gig. Back then, I was graduating, and after yet another one of those "yeah we liked you but we felt your skills were not up to par" interviews, I felt like I needed to go back to the basics and try to understand apps before learning how to break them. 

So begins the MERN Stack, with a React+Node+AWS+Nginx approach. It was pretty good for what it was, and pretty in tune I think with the 2010s, with an aim on being a static site to showcasing a portfolio and random, interesting things. Aka, blogging. 

In 2023, I felt that while it was time to move on to other technologies. While I have kept the documentation for the previous site since I do think it was useful, I've found my focus shifting to more on the dns and cloud side of things. As much as I do enjoy getting lost in CSS and the satisfaction of finally having React components work, this is just not something I found useful i the long run, even from a web application pen-testing spin on things.  -->

```

#### Threat Hunting

What SOC work eventually lead to. Detect, investigate, and mitigate. Learn to try and establish a motive to guess the target and where they might have gone. There is a reason your job has not been automated.
<br>
<br>
Stack: Splunk, Regex, Wireshark, EDR, Threat Detection

#### Forensics

The computer kind, or the investigation of system activity on digital devices to uncover evidence of a crime. I put Incident Response in this category, the whole Chain of Custody process, etc. The goal is to build up a narrative of what happened, like an actual crime scene.
<br>
<br>
Stack: Host-based Logs, EDR, MemprocFS, Volatility, Redline, Disk Forensics, Memory Forensics,

#### Active Directory

Homelabs galore, authentication, authorization, lots of Kerberos ticketing to test out the Threat Detection part. Think of this like a firing range.
<br>
<br>
Stack: Microsoft Active Directory, Kerberos, HyperV

#### Appsec Stuff

Honestly, a general umbrella term for software related projects, mainly playing around with API's

#### Cloud

Code For San Jose / Open Source San Jose stuff

#### Radio



#### Other Projects

> Want to learn coffee stuff?

> If you're looking for my art portfolio, that would be technomancer-01.com
{: .prompt-tip }

I think this jekyll setup is much better suited towards documentation, although I am already seeing that it loads images better so I may use it for art as well. One big component for me is the Tome Fragment aspect of them, how we're going to treat things as if they are actual historical documents to be analyzed. 

<br>
Projects: On the Nature of Tarnished Souls, Bloodborne in Wonderland, Coruscant Library, DnD, Tales From the Leyline Road, Delta Green, m4ven.OS, and Medicine Bun.
