Just a brief overview on a big update to this site from the old one, what it's for, and why. 

## Welcome

Use this as a repo for cluttered minds. Not sure if you're a tech worker, artist, barista, or the like but this website is a collection of various resources and annotations for me to use. Hopefully you'll find them useful too. 

## Origins



<!-- When pinging my then boyfriend for ideas, we came up with the name "Scavengers' Repo", mainly as a collection of random things. 

I made the original scavengers-repo.com in 2017 to get a grasp on the whole fullstack engineering gig. Back then, I was graduating, and after yet another one of those "yeah we liked you but we felt your skills were not up to par" interviews, I felt like I needed to go back to the basics and try to understand apps before learning how to break them. 

So begins the MERN Stack, with a React+Node+AWS+Nginx approach. It was pretty good for what it was, and pretty in tune I think with the 2010s, with an aim on being a static site to showcasing a portfolio and random, interesting things. Aka, blogging. 

In 2023, I felt that while it was time to move on to other technologies. While I have kept the documentation for the previous site since I do think it was useful, I've found my focus shifting to more on the dns and cloud side of things. As much as I do enjoy getting lost in CSS and the satisfaction of finally having React components work, this is just not something I found useful i the long run, even from a web application pen-testing spin on things.  -->


### Tech Stack

This site uses the Gitpage + Jekyll stack with the [Chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme.

Yeah, I got rid of the old MERN one, but that was a cost and upkeep reason. I'm here to show documentation mainly not be a developer


## Art 
> If you're looking for my art portfolio, that would be technomancer-01.com
{: .prompt-tip }

I think this jekyll setup is much better suited towards documentation, although I am already seeing that it loads images better so I may use it for art as well. One big component for me is the Tome Fragment aspect of them, how we're going to treat things as if they are actual historical documents to be analyzed. 

Projects: On the Nature of Tarnished Souls, Bloodborne in Wonderland, Coruscant Library, DnD, Tales From the Leyline Road, Delta Green, m4ven.OS, and Medicine Bun. 

## Tech

The meat of why you are here. I overhauled this site specifically because I wanted it to be more documentation focused instead of artsy, although it still seeps through.
